        <h2>About My Hobby</h2>
        <p>Drawing has always been my favorite hobby, and in recent years, I’ve expanded it into digital art as well. Whether it’s sketching with a pencil on paper or creating vibrant illustrations on a tablet, the process of bringing ideas to life is endlessly exciting. I love how traditional drawing helps me understand shapes, shadows, and textures, while digital tools let me experiment with colors, effects, and styles that would be impossible on paper.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For me, drawing—both traditional and digital—is a form of self-expression and relaxation. It lets me capture the world around me, imagine fantastical scenes, or convey emotions that words sometimes can’t express. Digital art adds another layer of freedom: I can undo mistakes instantly, try out different palettes, and even animate my creations. Over time, practicing both forms has improved my observation skills, creativity, and patience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the end, drawing and digital art are more than hobbies—they’re a way to explore my imagination, connect with my surroundings, and enjoy the process of creation.</p>
